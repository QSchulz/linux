X-Powers AXP20X and AXP22X PMIC Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

The X-Powers AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs have multiple ADCs. They expose the
battery voltage, battery charge and discharge currents, AC-in and VBUS
voltages and currents, 2 GPIOs muxable in ADC mode and PMIC temperature.

The AXP22X PMICs do not have all ADCs of the AXP20X though.

Required properties:
 - compatible, one of:
			"x-powers,axp209-adc"
			"x-powers,axp221-adc"

This is a subnode of the AXP20X PMIC.

Example:

&axp209 {
	axp209_adc: adc {
		compatible = "x-powers,axp209-adc";
	};
};
